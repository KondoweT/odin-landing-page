# Utility Tractor Product Landing Page

## Introduction
    This is the documentation for my odin project product landing page.
    The product landing page was designed in accordance with the theme
    which is provided by the odin project product landing page image.
    Most of the design elements and such as font, color,  margins are
    based on the font & color image provided.

## Funtionality
    The landing page is not as complex as a real product landing page.
    It doesn't have sales and cofigaration features, this landing page
    is designed as a landing page for products from just a few Utility Tractor companies.

## Atribution
- Images in the header of the product landing page were obtained from pixelbay a free online atribution free images website
- The other images were obtained from the manufactures product landing page
